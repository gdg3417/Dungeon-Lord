# Dungeon-Lord

Dungeon-Lord is a Unity dungeon-management MVP project focused on deterministic, config-owned simulation systems and legacy-safe iteration.

## Current status

Main is merged through PR #160 / GD62. GD62 added inactive DungeonSpatial contracts and pure deterministic validation; GD63 reconciles approved design decisions in documentation. The save schema remains version 6, the graph remains non-authoritative, and ordered two-room models remain runtime/save authority.

The current prototype supports a deterministic, player-completable first-session loop; configurable room/monster/trap/loot choices; an ordered, persistent two-room route; run analysis and route outcomes; research progress; heat, mana, and spoils feedback; and development-build validation. It does **not** yet activate physical tile footprints, corridors, a saved route graph, spatial capacity, multiple floors, or production dungeon-building UI. Floor 2 is only the first multi-floor foundation; the locked MVP remains one main dungeon with up to five floors.

Normal play still depends on the temporary Bootstrap overlay and simple MVP screen. These are validation surfaces, not the intended production editor, and will be replaced only after spatial contracts and editing behavior stabilize.

## Operating rules

- Keep resolver behavior deterministic and changes evidence-backed.
- Keep gameplay tuning in config and player-facing text in localization.
- Preserve additive, legacy-safe saves.

## Validation expectations

- Run Unity EditMode tests for code PRs.
- Run Bootstrap smoke tests for UI or diagnostics PRs.
- Attach validation evidence under `docs/testing/evidence`.
- Documentation-only PRs should run available text or formatting checks and confirm that no runtime, tuning, scene, prefab, asset, or `.meta` changes were introduced.

## Active plan after GD62

The authoritative execution sequence is the [post-GD60 MVP execution plan](docs/planning/post-gd60-mvp-execution-plan.md). The spatial contract is [System Spec 38](Docs/38%20-%20Dungeon_Floor_Spatial_Capacity_and_Route_Graph.md).

The current documentation packet is **GD63: Lock approved spatial design decisions and reconcile the post-GD62 plan**. The likely sequence is GD64 inactive spatial content/export validation, GD65 final migration design, then a separately reviewed migration implementation. None should activate competing layout authorities prematurely.
